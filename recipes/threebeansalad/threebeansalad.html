    <h2>Descrption</h2>
    <p>Three Bean Salad is a classic, refreshing side dish made with a mix of three types of beans—typically green
        beans, kidney beans, and garbanzo (chickpeas) or wax beans. The beans are tossed in a tangy-sweet dressing made
        from vinegar, oil, sugar, and seasonings. Often served chilled, it's a popular choice for picnics, potlucks, and
        barbecues due to its simplicity, bold flavor, and long shelf life.</p>
